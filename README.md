# tennis-club-android-app
This is an app for an imaginary tennis club which called Steffi Graf Tennis Club. It aims to inform the user about this tennis club. Youtube video of app: https://youtu.be/9PhPedM5ju8
At first screen it asks for the user’s name. When user enters his/her name and clicks the “CONTINUE” button, it shows a greeting message which includes the user’s name at second screen. There are 5 buttons at second screen. The user can get all information about the tennis club by using these buttons.
I have implemented the following functionality:
Easy Button Click,
Splash Screen,
WebView,
Intents (2) ( TO LAUNCH PHONE AND TO  LAUNCH MAPS ),
Java Button Click,
Basic List,
Pass Text,
ScrollView.
